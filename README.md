# LERC - Limited Error Raster Compression


## When to use

In image or raster compression, there are 2 different ways to go:

- compress an image as much as possible but so it still looks ok
  (jpeg and relatives). The max coding error per pixel can be large.

- need control over the max coding error per pixel (elevation, 
  scientific data, medical image data, ...).
  Because of that, such data is often compressed using lossless methods,
  such as LZW, gzip, and the like. The compression ratios achieved
  are often low. On top the encoding is often slow and time consuming. 

Lerc allows you to set the max coding error per pixel allowed, called 
"MaxZError". You can specify any number from 0 (lossless) to a number
so large that the decoded image may come out flat. 

In a nutshell, if jpeg is good enough for your images, use jpeg. If not,
if you would use png instead, or gzip, then you may want to try out Lerc. 


## Lerc Properties

- works on any common data type, not just 8 bit:
  char, byte, short, ushort, int, uint, float, double. 

- works with any given MaxZError or max coding error per pixel. 

- can work with a bit mask that specifies which pixels are valid
  and which ones are not. 

- is very fast: encoding time is about 20 ms per MegaPixel per band,
  decoding time is about 5 ms per MegaPixel per band. 

- compression is better than most other compression methods for 
  larger bitdepth data (>= 16 bit, float, double). 

- for 8 bit data lossless compression, PNG can be better, but is
  much slower. 

- in general for lossy compression with MaxZError > 0, the larger
  the error allowed, the stronger the compression. 

- this Lerc package can read all (legacy) versions of Lerc, such as
  Lerc(1), Lerc2 v1, and the current Lerc2 v2. It always writes 
  the current version Lerc2 v2.


## How to use

- build the solution in src/Lerc. Copy the resulting Lerc.lib to lib/.
- build the test app in src/LercTest. 
- run it. 

- the main include file is include/Lerc.h. See the comments there 
  about how to call the Lerc encode and decode functions. 

- packages such as MRF Lerc encode image data per band. This way 
  they can easily access each band individually. Lerc allows to
  stack bands together into a single Lerc blob. This can be useful 
  if the bands are always used together anyway.

## The Main Principle of Lerc

This section demonstrates how the same block of 4x4 pixels with floating point values gets Lerc encoded using two different values for MaxZError, the user specified coding error tolerance. The following is taken from the Lerc patent. The Lerc patent is available in the doc folder.

#### Example of LERC Encoding For One Block Using MaxZError = 0.01 m

In some embodiments, LERC encoding can be performed using four simplified basic steps including, but not limited to, (1) calculating the basic statistics for a data block; (2) determining how to encode the block using a user defined MaxZError value, (3) determining the number of bits needed and bit stuffing the non-negative integers; and (4) writing the block header.  FIG. 9A depicts sample block data 910 for a 4 x 4 block of pixels, according to an embodiment of the invention.   It should be noted that blocks are typically 8 x 8 pixels or larger, but are shown here as 4 x 4 pixels for simplicity of description.  At step 1, the LERC method includes determining the basic statistics for the data block of FIG. 9A. The minimum value is 1222.2943 and the maximum value is 1280.8725. The number of valid pixels (i.e., non-void pixels) is 12 of 16.  The number of invalid pixels (i.e., void pixels) is 4 of 16. At step 2, the LERC method includes determining whether the pixel block should be encoded uncompressed or with a user-input MaxZError of 0.01 m. By using equation (1) above: 

(Max-Min) / (2 x MaxZError) => (1280.8725-1222.2943) / (2 x 0.01) = 2,928.91. 

Since this value is less than 2^28, we can quantize the pixel values in data block 910 and expect an acceptable compression ratio. The block is quantized using equation (2) above, where each new pixel value is calculated by: 

n(i) = (unsigned int)((x(i) - Min) / (2 x MaxZError) + 0.5), 

resulting in the new pixel block 920 shown in FIG. 9B. At step (3), the method further includes determining the number of bits needed and bit stuffing these non-negative integers. The number of bits needed can be determined by equation (3): 
 
NumBits = ceil(log2(2929)) = 12

To represent the number of bits needed another way, 2^11 < 2929 < 2^12. In this case, 12 bits per number are needed to encode all numbers of block 910 lossless. There are 12 valid numbers, resulting in 12 x 12 = 144 bits total.  As 144 / 8 = 18, 18 bytes are needed to encode the entire data block.  At step (4), the method includes writing the block header as shown in FIG. 9C. It follows that 7 bytes are needed for the block header. The total number of bytes needed for block 920 can be calculated as 18 + 7 = 25 bytes.  In this particular case, the header takes too much space with respect to the raw pixel data, which exemplifies the need to work with block sizes of 8 x 8 pixels or larger.  


#### Example of LERC Encoding For One Block Using MaxZError = 1.0 m

Using the same 4 x 4 pixel block shown in FIG. 9A, the LERC method is performed again using a larger MaxZError (i.e., error threshold) of 1.0 m. Beginning with step (1), the minimum value is 1222.2943 and the maximum value is 1280.8725. The number of valid pixels (i.e., non-void pixels) is 12 of 16. The number of invalid pixels (i.e., void pixels) is 4 of 16. In step (2), the LERC method proceeds with determining whether the pixel block should be encoded uncompressed or with a user-input MaxZError of 1.0 m. As By using equation (1) above:

(Max-Min) / (2 x MaxZError) => (1280.8725-1222.2943) / (2 x 1.0) = 29.2891.

Since this value is less than 2^28, we can quantize the pixel values in data block 910 and expect an acceptable compression ratio.  The block is quantized using equation (2) above, where each new pixel value is calculated by: 

n(i) = (unsigned int)((x(i) - Min) / (2 x MaxZError) + 0.5), 

resulting in the new pixel block 940 shown in FIG. 9D. At step (3), the method further includes determining the number of bits needed and bit stuffing these non-negative integers. The number of bits needed can be determine by equation (3): 

NumBits = ceil(log2(29)) = 5

To represent the number of bits needed another way, 2^4 < 29 < 2^5. In this case, 5 bits per number are needed to encode all numbers of block 940 lossless. There are 12 valid numbers, resulting in 5 x 12 = 60 bits total. As 60 / 8 = 7.5, 8 bytes are needed to encode the entire data block. At step (4), the method includes writing the block header as shown in FIG. 9E. It follows that 7 bytes are needed for the block header. The total number of bytes needed for block 920 can be calculated as 8 + 7 = 15 bytes. 


## About bugs

The codecs Lerc2 and Lerc1 have been in use for years, bugs in those
low level modules are very unlikely. The top level layer that wraps 
the different Lerc versions is new. So if this package shows a bug,
it is most likely in that layer.
